                <h3>This project was born from two events:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Being a resident of the state of Oklahoma and growing up around the natural phenomena
                        known as Tornados </li>
                    <li>My graduate school database course at North Dakota State University challenging us to come up with
                        an original project that we're genuinely interested in that incorporates elements drawn from 
                        what we've learned throughout the course.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                The resulting project was both challenging and rewarding. I'd like to give a special thanks to Dr. Denton
                for the initial topic feedback which started the process into this journey.
            </p>
