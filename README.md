# TwisterTrends

This project aims to analyze tornado and climate change data to identify trends and correlations within the state of Oklahoma. Utilizing a database that integrates data from various tables—TornadoEvents, TemperatureData, GeographicalInformation, and WeatherStations—the project is designed to provide insightful analytics on how tornado occurrences and climate patterns are interrelated in this region.

Core Objectives:
Tornado Analysis: By examining data from TornadoEvents, the project focuses on understanding the frequency, severity, and geographic distribution of tornadoes in Oklahoma. Attributes like size, duration, and specific narratives provide a comprehensive view of each tornado event.
Climate Trend Examination: Utilizing TemperatureData, the project investigates temperature variations and anomalies over time. This includes analyzing average temperatures, observing extreme weather patterns, and understanding long-term climate trends in Oklahoma.
Geographical Correlation: With GeographicalInformation, the project correlates tornado occurrences and temperature changes with specific geographic locations. This helps in identifying areas more prone to extreme weather events and understanding how topography might influence climate patterns.
Weather Station Insights: The WeatherStations data offers insights into when and where weather monitoring has occurred and how these stations’ data contribute to understanding climate trends and tornado activities.

Analytical Approaches:
Trend Analysis: Identifying patterns in tornado occurrences and temperature changes over time. This includes assessing whether tornadoes are becoming more frequent or severe and how temperature patterns are evolving.
Correlation Studies: Exploring the relationship between temperature anomalies and tornado activities. The analysis seeks to understand if climate change indicators, like rising temperatures, correlate with increased tornado activity.
Geospatial Analysis: Using geographical data to map the occurrences of tornadoes and temperature changes, providing visual insights into how these phenomena are distributed across Oklahoma.
Temporal Analysis: Investigating how climate and tornado patterns vary across different times of the year, identifying seasonal trends and anomalies.
Impact:
The outcome of this project is crucial for multiple stakeholders, including meteorologists, climate scientists, policymakers, and emergency management authorities. By identifying trends and correlations between tornado activities and climate change, the project can inform better preparedness strategies, contribute to more accurate forecasting models, and guide policy decisions related to climate change mitigation and disaster management in Oklahoma.
